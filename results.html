              praise. Sometimes, differences between signs can bring balance,
              but this is only when there are enough other commonalities between

              <strong>Capricorn</strong> and <strong>Aries</strong>. This is a very difficult combination 
              of signs when it comes to sexual compatibility. Rulers of Aries and Capricorn are Mars and 
              Saturn. These planets are considered archetypal or karmic enemies. When it comes to sexuality, 
              it is mostly signified by Mars and its contact with Saturn may result in all sorts of physical 
              and objective obstacles on the way to a healthy sex life. Saturn puts too much pressure on Mars 
              and takes a lot of its energy. Their relationship will result in lack of sexual desire, the mutual 
              feeling of incompetence or even impotence of one or both included parties.

              <strong>Capricorn</strong> and <strong>Taurus</strong> can both be quite rigid when it comes to sex. 
              This is exactly what could make them a perfect couple. In combination with other signs of the zodiac 
              it can be hard for them to open up and feel the need to experiment, even though Capricorn will do their 
              best to show how ingenious they are when it comes to sex. When they get together and get to know each 
              other intimately, they will learn what it means to relax. Capricorn won’t feel the need to show off 
              and Taurus will let go of their fear of getting hurt.

            <h4>&#9811; Pisces and &#9802; Gemini</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Pisces</strong> and <strong>Gemini</strong> don’t exactly make a dream couple, except in a situation 
              when they really do. When they are made for each other, they will know it instantly, but in all other situations 
              any intimacy between them could seem as an impossible goal.

            <h4>&#9811; Pisces and &#9803; Cancer</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Pisces</strong> and <strong>Cancer</strong> belong to the element of Water and tend to share beautiful emotions, 
              falling in love with ease. In order to stay together, they should aim for absolute honesty and stay out of a boring routine.
            </p>

            <!-- Pisces and  Leo-->
            <h4>&#9811; Pisces and &#9804; Leo</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Pisces</strong> and <strong>Leo</strong>. It is incredible how two signs that represent love, can be so wrong for 
              each other. Leo will seem like a brute, caring selfishly about their own needs, incapable of forming an intimate relationship 
              with anyone, let alone Pisces. Although this is not true, it might be the obvious reality to Pisces if they end up in a 
              relationship with Leo Partner. In return, Leo will think of Pisces as weak and unrealistic, completely separated from their 
              own desires and the strength of their body or emotions.

            <!-- Pisces and Virgo-->
            <h4>&#9811; Pisces and &#9805; Virgo</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Pisces</strong> and <strong>Virgo</strong> When a Virgo and a Pisces partner begin their relationship, they have a 
              challenge to not expect absolute perfection. If they stay together for long enough, they might realize that emotions they 
              share cannot be found with anyone else.
            </p>
            
            <!-- Pisces and Libra -->
            <h4>&#9811; Pisces and &#9806; Libra</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Pisces</strong> and <strong>Libra</strong>. A relationship of Libra and Pisces can be quite challenging due to 
              the lack of respect between partners. If they move past it, they might find that their shared search for true love leads 
              them in the same direction.
            </p>
            
            <!-- Pisces and Scorpio -->
            <h4>&#9811; Pisces and &#9807; Scorpio</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Pisces</strong> and <strong>Scorpio</strong> can make a very good couple if they don’t end up playing the role of each 
              other’s opposites. They will understand each other with very few words and their love could last forever if they reach enough 
              emotional depth.
            </p>
            
            <!-- Pisces and Sagittarius -->
            <h4>&#9811; Pisces and &#9808; Sagittarius</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Pisces</strong> and <strong>Sagittarius</strong> are both ruled by Jupiter, and their relationship is full of optimism, 
              laughter and a shared love for the world and people in it. If they are to last, they need to respect their differences too.
            </p>
            
            <!-- Pisces and Capricorn -->
            <h4>&#9811; Pisces and &#9809; Capricorn</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Pisces</strong> and <strong>Capricorn</strong>. Capricorn can stabilize Pisces as much as Pisces will inspire Capricorn. 
              The outcome of their relationship depends on their shared beliefs and the boundaries they set for each other when Capricorn gets 
              too stiff and Pisces too flaky.
            </p>
            
            <!-- Pisces and Aquarius -->
            <h4>&#9811; Pisces and &#9810; Aquarius</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Pisces</strong> and <strong>Aquarius</strong> have a strong connection through Neptune, the representative of one, true, 
              fairytale love. If they happen to find emotional balance, they could have their very own happy ending.
            </p>
            
            <!-- Pisces and Pisces -->
            <h4>&#9811; Pisces and &#9811; Pisces</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Pisces</strong> and <strong>Pisces</strong>. At first glance, two Pisces representatives might become a perfect couple, 
              but when we scratch beneath the surface, we might see that they have real trouble getting close to each other. Their sex life 
              can be magical, but in many cases they will not even get to the physical contact, keeping their relationship senselessly platonic. 
              This is not a consequence of a lack of initiative, but rather their own need to stay in the bubble of emotional perfection and 
              their fear of bursting this bubble by forming a physical relationship that requires dealing with physical imperfections.
