# Love Riot ðŸ’˜ by Cupid&Co

## Intro

In the name of all things ***RoMaNcE*** this Valentine's February, The **Love Riot** web app showcases the **Love Compatibility Calculator**.
Based on zodiac star sign compatibility, users can calculate a potential compatibility score with their partner or crush and send the results on by email.

Compatibility scoring is displayed as a percentage match of the astrological star-signs of each person - adapted from [numerologysign.com](https://numerologysign.com/zodiac-signs-compatibility/)!
