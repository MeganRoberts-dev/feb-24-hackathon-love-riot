# Love Riot ðŸ’˜ by Cupid&Co

## Intro

In the name of all things ***RoMaNcE*** this Valentine's February, The **Love Riot** web app showcases the **Love Compatibility Calculator**.
Based on zodiac star sign compatibility, users can calculate a potential compatibility score with their partner or crush and send the results on by email.

Compatibility scoring is displayed as a percentage match of the astrological star-signs of each person - adapted from [numerologysign.com](https://numerologysign.com/zodiac-signs-compatibility/)!

# Site Goals


## Problem Statement

When it comes to the complexities of love and relationships, many people 'look to the stars' in order to analyse the potential of a budding romance between two people. We decided to build our Valentine's themed application as a Love Compatibility Calculator which is both fun to use and shares some insights into the compatibility of the astrological star-signs.

Our opening statement on the landing page for users:

***"Feeling lost in the maze of love? Wondering if you're on the right
path to happiness? Unveil the secrets of your relationships with
our Love Compatibility Calculator! Say goodbye to uncertainty and
hello to lasting connections."***


## Objectives

In the spirit of Valentine's day, our objective was to create a functioning love compatibility calculator game which displays a percentage compatibility score after the user has input two names and two zodiac star-signs.

### Target Audience

The target audience of this game is anyone interested in learning about astrological star-sign compatibility in romantic relationships. It can also be played as a light hearted game for all ages, especially around Valentine's Day, where the results can be forwarded to friends (or a crush) by email.

### User Requirements and Expectations

- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Explanation of how the site works is easy to understand
- Calulator game works as expected and is fun to play
- Clear presentation of the content
- Option to learn more about the page / access help with knowing which star-sign to choose
- Design that is visually attractive
- Accessibility
- Features and navigation system works as expected

### User Stories

As a user I would like:
- to understand what the app is about and how to use it.
- to calculate a love compatibility score using the interactive calculator on screen.

### Future Features

- Adding a horoscope API for generating detailed compatibility / prediction reports along with the results.
- Adding a pricing page for user to subscribe to our services such as reiki healing, cosmic realignment etc.

## Wireframes

Wireframes for the website were created using the UI wireframe tool, [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/), to plan the layout with a mobile-first approach.

The layout and design was kept consistent across the pages / devices as much as possible.

**Mobile Device Love Calculator with pre-game layout (left) and results page layout (right)**:

![wireframes](/documentation/readme/mobile-wireframes-love-calculator.jpg)

**Note** - The square boxes with X inside was used to illustrate a decorative / animated image. And in the early planning stages we had not yet decided between using 'birthdate' or 'star-sign' user input.


## Compatibility Scoring

The JS logic used to calculate the percentage compatibility scores were based on the Zodiac Signs Compatibility page by [numerologysign.com] (https://numerologysign.com/zodiac-signs-compatibility/).

We initially decided on calculating our own scores based on a compatibility grid such as this one from [astrology-zodiac-signs](https://www.astrology-zodiac-signs.com/images/zodiac-signs-compatibility-chart.png):

![planning stage compatibility grid](/documentation/readme/zodiac-compatibility-chart1.png)

However, we decided it was easier to calculate scores based on numerical data from a similar grid found at [numerologysigns.com](https://numerologysign.com/zodiac-signs-compatibility/):

![compatibility data grid used for final calculations](/documentation/readme/zodiac-compatibility-chart2.png)

The data for zodiac pairs was transcribed into a JS object (compatibilityData) which was then used in the calculation functionality of javascript.

To display different visuals associated with positive / negative scores, 'if/else' statements were run in the JS script depending on % brackets.

## Sending Results by Email

- EmailJS account was setup and linked to a custom Gmail account loveriot1402@gmail.com
- An HTML email template was created and uploaded into [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com).
- Images used in the email template are hosted on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) for public accessibility
